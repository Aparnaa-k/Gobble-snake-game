        <h1>Instructions:</h1>
        <p>
        1) Starting Position: The game begins with the snake located in the center square of the play field, and an egg appears
        randomly in one of the other squares.
        <br><br>
        2) Controls: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right) or on-screen touch controls to move the snake in the
        corresponding direction.
        <br><br>
        3) Collecting Eggs: Guide the snake to move over the eggs to collect them. Each egg consumed makes the snake grow longer.
        Movement: The snake can only move to adjacent squares in the grid (up, down, left, and right). Plan your moves carefully
        to avoid obstacles and self-collision.
        <br><br>
        4) Obstacles: Watch out for obstacles or barriers that may appear in the grid as you progress through the game. Colliding
        with obstacles or the boundaries of the grid ends the game.
        <br><br>
        5) Scoring: Your score increases with each egg consumed. You can also set a target score for players to reach to win the
        game.
        <br><br>
        6) Winning: To win the game, either reach the specified target score or guide the snake to a certain length by eating a
        specific number of eggs.
        <br><br>
        7) Losing: The game ends if the snake collides with an obstacle, runs into the grid's boundaries, or reaches a
        predetermined losing condition (e.g., hitting a specific length without reaching the target).
        <br><br>
        8)Restart/Quit: Players can restart the current level or choose to quit and return to the main menu as needed.
        High Score: Keep track of players' high scores so they can compete for the best score.
